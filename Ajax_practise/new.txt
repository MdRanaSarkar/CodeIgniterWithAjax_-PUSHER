XAMPP is meant only for development purposes. It has certain configuration settings 
that make it easy to develop locally but that are insecure if you want to have your 
installation accessible to others. If you want have your XAMPP accessible from the
internet, make sure you understand the implications and you checked the FAQs to
learn how to protect your site. Alternatively you can use WAMP, MAMP or LAMP
which are similar packages which are more suitable for production.

Start the XAMPP Control Panel to check the server status.
